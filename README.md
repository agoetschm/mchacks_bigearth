###[McHacks](http://mchacks.io) 2017 project
We first extracted about 20 features for all the countries from different Wikipedia pages with the help of [Beautiful Soup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/). With this data and some regression algorithm from the [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org) library we tried to predict the happiness rate given the other features.

Since the data scraping part took us much more time than expected, the result of the regression shouldn't be taken too seriously.
